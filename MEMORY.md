# Motherboard Operations Platform — Agent Memory

This file serves as a persistent, running log of all tasks performed, design decisions made, technical challenges resolved, and current workspace status. Every agent invocation updates this document to ensure perfect continuity across sessions.

## 2. Technical Decisions & Architecture

### Monorepo Infrastructure
- **Runtime & Package Manager:** Bun (latest stable)
- **Build System:** Turborepo
- **Workspace Layout:**
  - `apps/web`: Next.js 15 App Router + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
  - `apps/api`: Fastify 5 core backend
  - `packages/db`: Drizzle ORM client & migrations
  - `packages/iam`: Permission engine and policy evaluator
  - `packages/provisioning`: Discord integration sync worker
  - `packages/events`: In-process EventEmitter & Redis Pub/Sub events
  - `packages/plugin-sdk`: Plugin contract interfaces
  - `packages/ui`: Shared React components
  - `plugins/`: First- and third-party operational plugins
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (running in Docker)
- **Caching & Event Pub/Sub:** Redis 7 (running in Docker)

## 3. Key Learnings & Insights

### Workspace Configurations
- **Turborepo Workspace Discovery:** Turborepo requires the `"packageManager": "bun@1.3.11"` field in the root `package.json` to correctly resolve local workspace packages. Without it, the error `Could not resolve workspaces` is thrown.
- **Turborepo Task Dependencies:** By default, Turborepo tasks can specify dependencies on their upstream builds (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`). If upstream packages do not have a defined task script (like `build`), turbo will defer scheduling tasks for packages that depend on them. Direct execution via `tsc --noEmit` verifies typecheck correctness in early stages.

### Agent Rules
- **Memory Persistence:** Must update this `MEMORY.md` at the end of each session.
- **Skill Discovery:** Run `bunx skills find <topic>` before starting any phase. Do not guess APIs.
- **Anti-Hallucination:** Search the context window (Context7 or equivalent) every 3-4 files/major subsystems completed.

## 4. Session History & Task Log

### 2026-06-16 — Session 1: Planning and Scaffolding Rules
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Gemini 3.5 Flash)
- **Actions:**
  - Reviewed the monorepo design goals and build phases in [AGENTS.md](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/AGENTS.md).
  - Added the **Memory persistence rule** to [AGENTS.md](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/AGENTS.md) to ensure persistent knowledge handoff.
  - Created [MEMORY.md](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/MEMORY.md) file to log current workspace status.
  - Initialized Bun workspace and Turborepo.
  - Scaffolded the folder structure and all configurations (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, entry files) for all 8 packages and apps.
  - Configured root level files (`turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, placeholder Dockerfiles).
  - Successfully ran `bun install` and verified workspace-wide compilation using `tsc --noEmit` across all apps and packages.
- **Status:** Phase 0 complete and verified. Ready to start Phase 1.

### 2026-06-17 — Session 2: Documenting Skill Guidelines
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Gemini 3.5 Flash)
- **Actions:**
  - Added "AI Agent Skill-Specific Guidelines" to [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) to define precise usage triggers for codebase developer skills (matching exactly the folders in `.agents/skills`).
  - Updated [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) to add explicit conventions for always performing atomic commits.
  - Aligned the listed skills in [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) by removing `prd` and `reasoningbank-intelligence` as they are not present in `.agents/skills/`.
  - Added `prd`, `drizzle` & `drizzle-orm-expert`, and `react-patterns` & `react-performance` to the skill guidelines in [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) following their creation on disk.
  - Added the `token-efficiency` skill guideline to [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) after verifying its directory presence on disk. Checked for `safety-guard`, which is currently absent from `.agents/skills/` and therefore not listed in the guidelines.
- **Status:** Documentation updated successfully.

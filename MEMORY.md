- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (running in Docker)
- **Caching & Event Pub/Sub:** Redis 7 (running in Docker)

---

## 3. Key Learnings & Insights

### Workspace Configurations
- **Turborepo Workspace Discovery:** Turborepo requires the `"packageManager": "bun@1.3.11"` field in the root `package.json` to correctly resolve local workspace packages. Without it, the error `Could not resolve workspaces` is thrown.
- **Turborepo Task Dependencies:** By default, Turborepo tasks can specify dependencies on their upstream builds (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`). If upstream packages do not have a defined task script (like `build`), turbo will defer scheduling tasks for packages that depend on them. Direct execution via `tsc --noEmit` verifies typecheck correctness in early stages.

### Agent Rules
- **Memory Persistence:** Must update this `MEMORY.md` at the end of each session.
- **Skill Discovery:** Run `bunx skills find <topic>` before starting any phase. Do not guess APIs.
- **Anti-Hallucination:** Search the context window (Context7 or equivalent) every 3-4 files/major subsystems completed.

### 2026-06-17 — Session 9: Rewrite Specification for FastAPI Backend
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Gemini 3.5 Flash)
- **Actions:**
  - Brainstormed and aligned on the Python directory layout, using Approach 1 where core backend packages (IAM, Database, Provisioning, Event Bus, Plugin SDK) are placed inside `apps/api/app/` as internal modules, and Next.js acts as the decoupled frontend.
  - Selected async SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic migrations for the database layer.
  - Rewrote [techspec.md](file:///d:/motherboard/docs/techspec.md) to define the FastAPI/Python monorepo structure, technology versions, SQLAlchemy ORM schema tables, async principal resolution and policy validation, typed asyncio and Redis event bus, dynamic plugin router loading, background sync worker, and uv-based Dockerfiles.
  - Synchronized the embedded specification copy inside [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/motherboard/AGENTS.md) to maintain absolute consistency across workspace instructions.
  - Deleted the obsolete Drizzle skills (`drizzle`, `drizzle-orm-expert`) from `.agents/skills/` and removed them from `skills-lock.json`.
  - Verified both specifications are clean, complete, and contain no TODO/TBD placeholders.
- **Status:** Backend specification fully transitioned to FastAPI, and all documents synchronized.


### 2026-06-17 — Session 10: Phase 0 Planning for FastAPI Repo Realignment
- **Actor:** Code
- **Actions:**
  - Read `docs/techspec.md`, the current root workspace files, Docker config, and memory notes to compare the FastAPI edition spec against the live Bun/TypeScript scaffold.
  - Ran `bunx skills find brainstorming` and `bunx skills find plan-orchestrate` as required before planning work.
  - Launched a nine-agent planning batch to synthesize a Phase 0 execution plan from multiple model perspectives.
  - Confirmed the repo still contains the old TypeScript backend packages (`packages/db`, `packages/iam`, `packages/events`, `packages/plugin-sdk`, `packages/provisioning`) and a Fastify-oriented `apps/api` scaffold.
  - Identified the main Phase 0 migration gap: the spec now expects a hybrid Bun + uv layout with `apps/api` converted to FastAPI/Python and backend domains moved under `apps/api/app/`.
- **Status:** Planning complete; implementation has not started yet. Next step is to execute the agreed Phase 0 repo realignment.

### 2026-06-17 — Session 11: Phase 0 Execution for FastAPI Repo Realignment
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Gemini 3.1 Pro)
- **Actions:**
  - Deleted obsolete TypeScript backend packages (`packages/db`, `packages/iam`, `packages/events`, `packages/plugin-sdk`, `packages/provisioning`).
  - Removed old Fastify scaffolding from `apps/api` (`src`, `node_modules`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
  - Verified `apps/api` Python layout using `uv` matching the specification.
  - Confirmed `apps/web` depends only on `@bnb/ui`.
- **Status:** Phase 0 execution complete. Repository is correctly realigned to the hybrid Bun + uv FastAPI spec. Ready for Phase 1.

### 2026-06-17 — Session 12: Cinematic Space-Travel Landing Page
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Gemini 3.5 Flash)
- **Actions:**
  - Brainstormed and implemented a high-fidelity Space-Travel Landing Page in `apps/web` utilizing Next.js 15 App Router and React 19.
  - Installed `framer-motion` in `apps/web` for entrance animations.
  - Authored a custom JS-based [FadingVideo.tsx](file:///d:/motherboard/apps/web/components/FadingVideo.tsx) player using requestAnimationFrame to handle manual looping and 500ms opacity crossfading.
  - Authored [BlurText.tsx](file:///d:/motherboard/apps/web/components/BlurText.tsx) to animate text word-by-word with staggered opacity/blur transitions triggered by a 10% threshold IntersectionObserver.
  - Implemented [HeroSection.tsx](file:///d:/motherboard/apps/web/components/HeroSection.tsx) with a fixed glass navbar, stats display cards, and entrance animations.
  - Implemented [CapabilitiesSection.tsx](file:///d:/motherboard/apps/web/components/CapabilitiesSection.tsx) with a kicker, title, and three interactive liquid-glass cards (AI Scenery, Batch Production, Smart Lighting) containing customized SVGs.
  - Added `.liquid-glass` and `.liquid-glass-strong` styles to the shared index.css stylesheet in [packages/ui](file:///d:/motherboard/packages/ui/src/index.css) and updated package exports to expose the CSS to Next.js.
  - Verified a clean and successful compilation and Turborepo build (`bun run build`) with no TypeScript or Next.js Webpack compile errors.
- **Status:** Cinematic space-travel landing page successfully implemented, styled, verified, and compiled.

### 2026-06-17 — Session 13: Phase 1 — Database Schema Implementation
- **Actor:** Antigravity (Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking)
- **Actions:**
  - Read MEMORY.md, techspec.md, and all existing app/api files to understand exact current state.
  - Read fastapi/SKILL.md for best practices before writing any code.
  - Created [app/db/models.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/db/models.py) with 13 SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM tables using full `Mapped[]` type annotations, `relationship()` with cascades, composite indexes, and JSONB columns.
  - Created [app/db/seed_data.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/db/seed_data.py) with 15 system groups, 24 core permissions, 14 Discord role→group mappings (from AGENTS.md role hierarchy), and 12 city forks.
  - Created [app/db/seeder.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/db/seeder.py) with idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` seed runner.
  - Updated [app/db/__init__.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/db/__init__.py) with clean public exports.
  - Updated [app/main.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/main.py) with lifespan context manager: auto-migrate via Alembic, auto-seed on boot, CORS middleware, and router registration.
  - Updated [app/config.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/config.py) with `redis_url` and `cors_origins` fields.
  - Updated [app/dependencies.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/dependencies.py) with `DbSession` and `AppSettings` typed Annotated aliases.
  - Wrote 7 API routers: [health.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/health.py), [users.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/users.py), [groups.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/groups.py), [forks.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/forks.py), [audit.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/audit.py), [sync.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/sync.py), [plugins.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/app/routers/plugins.py).
  - Wrote 6 schema files: users, groups, forks, audit, sync, plugins (all Pydantic v2 with `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)`).
  - Fixed `pyproject.toml`: added `[tool.fastapi]` entrypoint, `[build-system]` hatchling block, and `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` package path.
  - Initialized Alembic (`uv run alembic init alembic`).
  - Configured [alembic/env.py](file:///home/equation/Projects/motherboard/apps/api/alembic/env.py) with async engine, NullPool, and `Base.metadata` autogenerate.
  - Ran `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial_schema"` → detected all 13 tables + indexes.
  - Ran `alembic upgrade head` → all 13 tables live in Postgres (confirmed via `\dt`).
  - Committed 29 files on branch `db/init-schema` (commit `c6c8769`).
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Added `Fork` and `ForkMember` tables beyond the spec's original set — necessary for the fork-scoped IAM checks described in AGENTS.md.
  - Added `SyncRun` table for Discord provisioning observability.
  - Used `slug` as unique identifier for Group and Fork (in addition to UUID PK) for human-readable API paths and seed conflict resolution.
  - Used `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for all seeds so the seeder is safe to run on every container start.
  - Used polymorphic `principal_id` in grants (not FKs) to support both user and group grants in one table — a deliberate trade-off for query simplicity.
- **Status:** Phase 1 complete and verified. All 13 tables live in Postgres. Ready for Phase 2 (IAM module).

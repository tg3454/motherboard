The internal operations platform for the **bits&bytes** network. 

Motherboard acts as the central Identity & Access Management (IAM) engine, provisioning worker, and event/plugin SDK platform for coordinating all local city forks, contributor roles, and discord integrations.

For details on development phases and future feature integrations, see the [Project Roadmap](file:///d:/motherboard/docs/roadmap.md).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Core:** Discord-linked authentication using NextAuth.js. Guild roles are imported and mapped dynamically to internal operational groups.
*   **Provisioning Engine:** An active sync worker keeping internal user roles, city forks, and entitlements synchronized with the Discord guild on-demand or scheduled.
*   **Plugin Platform:** An extensible SDK allowing first-party and third-party plugins to declare custom database migrations, Fastify routes, UI panels, permissions, and audit logs.
*   **Web Dashboard:** Next.js 15 App Router frontend leveraging Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and a custom Neo-Brutalist design system (see [design.md](file:///d:/motherboard/docs/design.md)) for a premium, high-contrast dashboard experience.
*   **Discord Bot Integration Layer:** Structured API/WebSocket interface hook for the bits&bytes Discord bot to sync identities, roles, and targeted user profiles.

## ⚙️ Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed locally.

### 2. Install Dependencies
From the root of the workspace:
```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Environment Secrets
Create a `.env` file in the root based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure you configure your `DATABASE_URL`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

### 4. Running Locally
Spin up local dependencies (Postgres & Redis) via Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

Start the Monorepo in development mode:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📜 Codebase Conventions

*   **Package Scope:** All shared packages use the `@bnb/` scope (e.g. `@bnb/db`, `@bnb/iam`).
*   **Commit Style:** Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.).
*   **Atomic Commits:** Keep commits small, isolated, and focused on a single logical change.

# bnb-motherboard — Agent Build Instructions (FastAPI Edition)

> **Before starting any phase:** Run `bunx skills find <topic>` to locate relevant skill documentation for the task at hand (e.g. `bunx skills find drizzle orm`, `bunx skills find nextjs app router`, `bunx skills find discord oauth`). For Python/FastAPI backend tasks, verify with `bunx skills find fastapi` and `bunx skills find fastapi-patterns`. Use the outputs to guide implementation — do not guess at APIs.
>
> **Anti-hallucination rule:** After every 3–4 files created or every major subsystem completed, stop and search your context window (context 7 or equivalent) for the latest state of relevant interfaces, schemas, and type contracts before continuing. Write code against what actually exists in the codebase, not against memory.

## What Is Being Built

**bnb-motherboard** is the internal operations platform for the bits&bytes network. It serves as:

- An **Identity & Access Management (IAM) core** — Discord is the upstream identity provider. Users log in via Discord OAuth. Discord guild roles are imported via the Discord API and mapped to internal groups through an admin UI.
- A **provisioning engine** — a sync worker keeps internal users, roles, and entitlements in sync with the Discord guild on a schedule and on-demand.
- A **plugin platform** — an elaborately specified SDK allows first- and third-party plugins to register routes (with the FastAPI app), UI panels (using the Next.js shell and shared component library), event bus subscriptions, database migrations, permissions, and audit entries.
- A **web dashboard** — Next.js 15 frontend decoupled from the FastAPI backend via a clean REST API boundary.
- A **Discord bot integration layer** — the existing bits&bytes Discord bot connects to the motherboard over HTTP/WebSocket to sync identity state. The bot is NOT rebuilt here; only the integration contract is defined and the sync endpoint is implemented.

All services run in Docker containers orchestrated with Docker Compose for self-hosted VPS deployment.

## Required Secrets — Gather Before Starting

The agent must not proceed to Phase 2 until the operator confirms all of the following are available as environment variables. Create a `.env.example` at the repo root and document every variable.

| Variable | Description | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth2 app client ID | Discord Developer Portal → OAuth2 |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth2 app client secret | Discord Developer Portal → OAuth2 |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token for guild member/role sync | Discord Developer Portal → Bot |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | The bits&bytes Discord server ID | Right-click server → Copy Server ID |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string | Self-hosted container (auto-generated in docker-compose, e.g., `postgresql+asyncpg://bnb:pwd@postgres:5432/motherboard`) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string for cookie signing / sessions | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 64` |
| `API_INTERNAL_SECRET` | Shared secret between API and Bot | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth.js secret | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Public URL of the Next.js app | VPS domain or `http://localhost:3000` |
| `API_URL` | Internal URL of FastAPI API | `http://api:8000` in Docker, `http://localhost:8000` locally |

**Discord OAuth redirect URI** to register in the Developer Portal:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord` (development)
- `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/discord` (production)

***

## Monorepo Structure

The project has a hybrid structure: Next.js frontend and React shared libraries use Bun workspace orchestration, while the FastAPI backend uses Python with `uv` package management.

**Naming conventions:**
- TypeScript packages use `@bnb/` scope (e.g. `@bnb/ui`).
- Python code follows PEP 8 styling conventions (directories and file names: `snake_case`).
- TypeScript files: `kebab-case`.

### Granular Access Control & Permissions Matrix

The authentication engine evaluates command permissions and Notion access rules through nested logic gates.

#### 1. Global Admins (HQ, Executive Leadership, Staff)
*   **Identification**: Holds Server Admin permissions, `STAFF_ROLE_IDS`, or name matching (`hq`, `Executive Leadership`, `staff`).
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Full Access**: Implicit read and write (modify) privileges across all forks, Notion databases, meetings, and configurations.
    *   **Bypasses All Scoping**: Automatically passes `isAuthorizedForCity` and `isAuthorizedForForkId` gates.

#### 2. Department Leads (Global Track Leads)
*   **Identification**: Holds the `outreach-lead`, `tech-lead`, `creative-lead`, or `ops-lead` roles.
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Cross-Fork Control**: Treated as Global Admins for execution purposes.
    *   **Full Access**: Bypasses local city checks, allowing view & modification of all fork pages and event structures.

#### 3. Parent Track Contributors
*   **Identification**: Holds the `@Contributor` role + a global track role (e.g., `tech`, `ops`, `creative`, `outreach`) but **does not** hold any local `contributor-{city}` role.
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Cross-Fork VIEW Access**: Authorized to *view* the dashboard, health scores, and metrics of any city fork.
    *   **No Modify Privileges**: Cannot create events, submit reports, or modify fork status.

#### 4. Fork Leads
*   **Identification**: Meets Local Fork Member requirements + holds the `Fork Lead` role (or designated as lead in the Notion registry).
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Full Local Control**: Full read and write (modify) access to any data associated with their specific city fork.
    *   **No Cross-Fork Access**: Cannot view or modify private data from other city forks.

#### 5. Local Track Leads (Fork Department Leads)
*   **Identification**: Meets Local Fork Member requirements + holds a track lead role (e.g. `tech-lead` / `Tech Lead`, `creative-lead` / `Creative Lead`, `ops-lead` / `Ops Lead`, `outreach-lead` / `Outreach Lead`).
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **General Local VIEW**: Can view all aspects of their own city fork.
    *   **Track-Restricted Modify**: Can modify fork components and events *only if* the target activity falls within their track (e.g., a `tech-lead` can schedule a technical event or modify a tech report for their fork, but cannot modify creative tasks).

#### 6. Fork Contributors
*   **Identification**: Holds `@Contributor` + city role + `contributor-{city}` role.
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Local VIEW-Only**: Can view all elements of their own city fork.
    *   **No Modify Privileges**: Cannot execute administrative/update commands.

#### 7. Fork Community Members
*   **Identification**: Holds the city role (e.g., `delhi`) but **does not** hold the `@Contributor` role.
*   **Permissions**:
    *   **Public Local VIEW**: Can view public channels and resources of their city fork.
    *   **No Private Access**: Cannot view restricted contributor channels or execute bot commands.

### Dynamic Meeting Scopes

Meeting recording voice channels use role-scoping variables to dynamically establish permissions:

*   `invite`: Only explicit meeting attendees are granted join permissions.
*   `open`: Any user holding the `@Contributor` or `hq` role can join.
*   `hq`: Restricted solely to members holding the `hq` role.
*   `fork:{city}`: Restricted to members holding the `contributor-{city}` role.
*   `network:{track}`: Restricted to members holding the global track role (e.g., `tech`).
*   `fork:{city}:{track}`: Restricts access to members who hold **both** the city contributor role and the track role.

## Phase 0 — Repository Scaffolding

### 0.1 Initialize the Bun Monorepo (Frontend & Shared UI)
Initialize Bun at the monorepo root to orchestrate the Next.js app and TypeScript package workspaces:
```bash
bun init -y
```

Configure `package.json` to configure the TypeScript/Next.js workspaces:
```json
{
  "name": "bnb-motherboard",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/web",
    "packages/ui",
    "plugins/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "typecheck": "turbo run typecheck",
    "lint": "turbo run lint"
  }
}
```

Install Turborepo locally:
```bash
bun add -D turbo
```

Configure `turbo.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```

### 0.2 Initialize the Python / uv Workspace (Backend)
Set up the `apps/api` directory as an independent Python package managed by `uv`:
```bash
cd apps/api
uv init --app app
```

This creates a `pyproject.toml` in `apps/api/`. Add the required python dependencies:
```toml
[project]
name = "bnb-api"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "FastAPI backend core for the bnb-motherboard platform"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.111.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.1",
    "pydantic[email]>=2.7.4",
    "pydantic-settings>=2.3.4",
    "sqlalchemy[asyncio]>=2.0.31",
    "asyncpg>=0.29.0",
    "alembic>=1.13.1",
    "python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0",
    "httpx>=0.27.0",
    "redis>=5.0.6",
    "apscheduler>=3.10.4",
]
```

### 0.3 Docker Compose configuration
Create a central `docker-compose.yml` in the root mapping the services:

## Phase 1 — Database Schema (`apps/api/app/db`)

Backend database logic is mapped using **SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative tables** with type annotations. Asyncpg serves as the async driver.

### 1.1 ORM Table Definitions

Create `apps/api/app/db/models.py`. Ensure all relationships are fully declared using `relationship()` with appropriate cascade properties:

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any, List, Optional
from sqlalchemy import Boolean, DateTime, ForeignKey, String, Text, UniqueConstraint, func
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB, UUID
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column, relationship

class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    display_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100), nullable=False)
    email: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=True)
    avatar_url: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(String(500), nullable=True)
    is_active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=True, nullable=False)
    is_super_admin: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
    updated_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())

    discord_account: Mapped[Optional["DiscordAccount"]] = relationship("DiscordAccount", back_populates="user", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
    memberships: Mapped[List["Membership"]] = relationship("Membership", back_populates="user", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

    user_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    group_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("groups.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    source: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(50), default="manual")  # 'discord_sync' | 'manual' | 'provisioning'

    sync_enabled: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=True, nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())

    expires_at: Mapped[Optional[datetime]] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())

class Delegation(Base):
    __tablename__ = "delegations"

    id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    delegator_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    delegatee_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
    permission_key: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100), ForeignKey("permissions.key", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)

    config: Mapped[dict[str, Any]] = mapped_column(JSONB, default=dict, nullable=False)
```

### 1.2 Alembic Setup and Migrations
Initialize Alembic inside `apps/api/`:
```bash
uv run alembic init alembic
```

Modify `alembic/env.py` to point to the base metadata:
```python
from app.db.models import Base
target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

Generate migrations:
```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

***

## Phase 2 — IAM Module (`apps/api/app/iam`)

The IAM module evaluates user/group permissions using async session engines.

### 2.1 Principal Resolution
Create `apps/api/app/iam/principal.py`:
```python
import uuid
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy import select
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.db.models import User, Membership

class ResolvedPrincipal(BaseModel):
    user_id: uuid.UUID
    group_ids: List[uuid.UUID]
    is_super_admin: bool

async def resolve_principal(db: AsyncSession, user_id: uuid.UUID) -> ResolvedPrincipal:
    user_stmt = select(User).where(User.id == user_id)
    user_res = await db.execute(user_stmt)
    user = user_res.scalar_one_or_none()
    
    if not user or not user.is_active:
        raise ValueError("User not found or deactivated")
        
    membership_stmt = select(Membership.group_id).where(Membership.user_id == user_id)
    membership_res = await db.execute(membership_stmt)
    group_ids = list(membership_res.scalars().all())
    
    return ResolvedPrincipal(
        user_id=user.id,
        group_ids=group_ids,
        is_super_admin=user.is_super_admin
    )
```

### 2.2 Policy Evaluator
Create `apps/api/app/iam/policy.py`:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from typing import Optional
from sqlalchemy import select, and_, or_, is_
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.db.models import Grant
from .principal import ResolvedPrincipal

async def can(
    db: AsyncSession,
    principal: ResolvedPrincipal,
    permission_key: str,
    resource_scope: Optional[str] = None
) -> bool:
    if principal.is_super_admin:
        return True
        
    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    
    # User-direct or group-level grants conditions
    principal_conditions = [
        and_(Grant.principal_type == "user", Grant.principal_id == principal.user_id)
    ]
    if principal.group_ids:
        principal_conditions.append(
            and_(Grant.principal_type == "group", Grant.principal_id.in_(principal.group_ids))
        )
        
    grant_filter = and_(
        or_(*principal_conditions),
        Grant.permission_key == permission_key,
        or_(is_(Grant.expires_at, None), Grant.expires_at > now)
    )
    
    stmt = select(Grant).where(grant_filter)
    res = await db.execute(stmt)
    matching_grants = res.scalars().all()
    
    if not matching_grants:
        return False
        
    if not resource_scope:
        return True
        
    # Grant matches if it has a null resource_scope (global wildcard) or matches exactly
    return any(g.resource_scope is None or g.resource_scope == resource_scope for g in matching_grants)
```

### 2.3 System Groups Seeds
Create `apps/api/app/iam/constants.py`:
```python
SYSTEM_GROUPS = {
    "SUPER_ADMIN": "sg_super_admin",
    "STAFF": "sg_staff",
    "FORK_LEAD": "sg_fork_lead",
    "CONTRIBUTOR": "sg_contributor",
    "MEMBER": "sg_member"
}
```

***

## Phase 3 — Event Bus (`apps/api/app/events`)

The internal events module handles async signaling between modules, with an optional Redis Pub/Sub backend for multi-instance deployments.

### 3.1 Typed Event Schemas
Create `apps/api/app/events/types.py`:
```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Literal, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserCreatedPayload(BaseModel):
    user_id: str

class GroupMemberAddedPayload(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    group_id: str
    source: str

class DiscordSyncCompletedPayload(BaseModel):
    synced_count: int
    errors: list[str]

class Event(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["user.created", "group.member.added", "discord.sync.completed"]
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 3.2 Event Bus Implementation
Create `apps/api/app/events/bus.py`:
```python
import asyncio
import json
import logging
from typing import Any, Callable, Coroutine, Dict, List, Optional
import redis.asyncio as aioredis

logger = logging.getLogger("event_bus")

class EventBus:
    def __init__(self, redis_url: Optional[str] = None):
        self._listeners: Dict[str, List[Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]]] = {}
        self.redis_url = redis_url
        self.redis: Optional[aioredis.Redis] = None
        self._pubsub_task: Optional[asyncio.Task] = None

    async def start(self):
        if self.redis_url:
            self.redis = aioredis.from_url(self.redis_url, decode_responses=True)
            self._pubsub_task = asyncio.create_task(self._redis_listener())

    async def _redis_listener(self):
        pubsub = self.redis.pubsub()
        await pubsub.subscribe("motherboard_events")
        async for message in pubsub.listen():
            if message["type"] == "message":
                data = json.loads(message["data"])
                await self._trigger_local(data["type"], data["payload"])

    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, callback: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]):
        if event_type not in self._listeners:
            self._listeners[event_type] = []
        self._listeners[event_type].append(callback)

    async def publish(self, event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]):
        event_data = {"type": event_type, "payload": payload}
        # Trigger local execution
        await self._trigger_local(event_type, payload)
        # Push to Redis for cross-node instances
        if self.redis:
            await self.redis.publish("motherboard_events", json.dumps(event_data))

    async def _trigger_local(self, event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]):
        callbacks = self._listeners.get(event_type, [])
        for cb in callbacks:
            try:
                asyncio.create_task(cb(payload))
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error executing subscriber callback for {event_type}: {e}")

event_bus = EventBus()
```

***

## Phase 4 — Plugin SDK (`apps/api/app/plugin_sdk`)

The plugin platform allows Python packages to register routes and logic with the motherboard backend, while their React counterparts are loaded by the Next.js shell.

### 4.1 Plugin Lifecycle Contracts
Create `apps/api/app/plugin_sdk/types.py`:
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Coroutine, Dict, List, Literal, Optional
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

class PluginContext(BaseModel):
    plugin_id: str
    db_session: AsyncSession
    
    # Core system wrappers
    audit: Callable[[str, str, str, Dict[str, Any]], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]
    publish_event: Callable[[str, Dict[str, Any]], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]
    
    model_config = {"arbitrary_types_allowed": True}

class PermissionDeclaration(BaseModel):
    key: str
    description: str

class UiPanelDeclaration(BaseModel):
    id: str
    title: str
    route_segment: str
    placement: Literal["sidebar", "modal", "embedded"]
    required_permission: Optional[str] = None
    icon: str

class PluginManifest(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    version: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Router instances to mount under /api/plugins/<plugin_id>
    router: Optional[APIRouter] = None
    
    # Lifecycle hooks
    on_load: Optional[Callable[[FastAPI, PluginContext], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]] = None
    on_unload: Optional[Callable[[PluginContext], Coroutine[Any, Any, None]]] = None
    
    permissions: List[PermissionDeclaration] = []
    ui_panels: List[UiPanelDeclaration] = []
    
    model_config = {"arbitrary_types_allowed": True}
```

### 4.2 Dynamic Plugin Loader
The loader dynamically checks the `plugins/` directory, adds the directory to `sys.path`, loads the modules dynamically, runs any database schema updates declared in migrations, and mounts their FastAPI routers:

Create `apps/api/app/plugin_sdk/loader.py`:
```python
import importlib
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Any
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import async_sessionmaker, AsyncSession
from .types import PluginManifest, PluginContext

class PluginLoader:
    def __init__(self, app: FastAPI, session_factory: async_sessionmaker, plugins_dir: str = "../../plugins"):
        self.app = app
        self.session_factory = session_factory
        self.plugins_dir = Path(plugins_dir)
        self.loaded_plugins: Dict[str, PluginManifest] = {}

    async def discover_and_load(self):
        if not self.plugins_dir.exists():
            return

        for p_dir in self.plugins_dir.iterdir():
            if not p_dir.is_dir():
                continue
                
            api_path = p_dir / "api"
            if not api_path.exists():
                continue
                
            # Add plugin api to path and load dynamic package
            sys.path.insert(0, str(api_path.resolve()))
            try:
                plugin_module = importlib.import_module("main")
                manifest: PluginManifest = plugin_module.get_manifest()
                
                await self.load_plugin(manifest)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to load plugin from {p_dir}: {e}")
            finally:
                sys.path.pop(0)

    async def load_plugin(self, manifest: PluginManifest):
        # 1. Mount Router
        if manifest.router:
            self.app.include_router(
                manifest.router,
                prefix=f"/api/plugins/{manifest.id}",
                tags=[f"plugin:{manifest.id}"]
            )
            
        # 2. Run initial tasks via on_load hook
        async with self.session_factory() as session:
            ctx = PluginContext(
                plugin_id=manifest.id,
                db_session=session,
                audit=self._make_audit_fn(manifest.id, session),
                publish_event=self._make_publish_fn()
            )
            if manifest.on_load:
                await manifest.on_load(self.app, ctx)
                
        self.loaded_plugins[manifest.id] = manifest

    def _make_audit_fn(self, plugin_id: str, session: AsyncSession):
        from app.iam.audit import write_audit_entry
        async def audit_fn(action: str, target_type: str, target_id: str, meta: Dict[str, Any]):
            await write_audit_entry(session, actor_id=None, action=f"plugin.{plugin_id}.{action}", target_type=target_type, target_id=target_id, metadata=meta)
        return audit_fn

    def _make_publish_fn(self):
        from app.events.bus import event_bus
        async def publish_fn(event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]):
            await event_bus.publish(event_type, payload)
        return publish_fn
```

***

## Phase 5 — Provisioning Worker (`apps/api/app/provisioning`)

The provisioning worker fetches guild member mappings from Discord, compares them to mapped roles, and writes synchronization updates back to internal database groups.

### 5.1 Discord REST Client
Create `apps/api/app/provisioning/client.py`:
```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List
import httpx

class DiscordClient:
    def __init__(self, bot_token: str):
        self.bot_token = bot_token
        self.base_url = "https://discord.com/api/v10"
        self.headers = {"Authorization": f"Bot {self.bot_token}"}

    async def get_guild_members(self, guild_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        members = []
        limit = 1000
        after = "0"
        
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url=self.base_url, headers=self.headers) as client:
            while True:
                resp = await client.get(
                    f"/guilds/{guild_id}/members",
                    params={"limit": limit, "after": after}
                )
                resp.raise_for_status()
                data = resp.json()
                if not data:
                    break
                members.extend(data)
                after = data[-1]["user"]["id"]
                if len(data) < limit:
                    break
        return members

    async def get_roles(self, guild_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url=self.base_url, headers=self.headers) as client:
            resp = await client.get(f"/guilds/{guild_id}/roles")
            resp.raise_for_status()
            return resp.json()
```

### 5.2 Synchronization Task
Create `apps/api/app/provisioning/sync.py`:
```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from sqlalchemy import select
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.db.models import DiscordAccount, DiscordRoleMapping, Membership
from app.provisioning.client import DiscordClient

logger = logging.getLogger("sync_worker")

async def run_sync(db: AsyncSession, discord_client: DiscordClient, guild_id: str) -> dict:
    errors = []
    synced_count = 0
    
    try:
        # 1. Fetch Discord users and mapped database roles
        members = await discord_client.get_guild_members(guild_id)
        
        map_stmt = select(DiscordRoleMapping).where(DiscordRoleMapping.sync_enabled == True)
        map_res = await db.execute(map_stmt)
        mappings = map_res.scalars().all()
        mapping_dict = {m.discord_role_id: m.group_id for m in mappings}
        
        # 2. Iterate and sync roles
        for member in members:
            discord_id = member["user"]["id"]
            roles = member["roles"]
            
            acc_stmt = select(DiscordAccount).where(DiscordAccount.discord_id == discord_id)
            acc_res = await db.execute(acc_stmt)
            account = acc_res.scalar_one_or_none()
            
            if not account:
                continue  # User has not registered in the app dashboard yet
                
            user_id = account.user_id
            
            # Fetch current user synced memberships
            mem_stmt = select(Membership).where(
                Membership.user_id == user_id,
                Membership.source == "discord_sync"
            )
            mem_res = await db.execute(mem_stmt)
            current_mems = {m.group_id: m for m in mem_res.scalars().all()}
            
            target_group_ids = {mapping_dict[r] for r in roles if r in mapping_dict}
            
            # Add missing memberships
            for group_id in target_group_ids:
                if group_id not in current_mems:
                    new_mem = Membership(
                        user_id=user_id,
                        group_id=group_id,
                        source="discord_sync"
                    )
                    db.add(new_mem)
                    synced_count += 1
            
            # Remove stale memberships
            for group_id, membership in current_mems.items():
                if group_id not in target_group_ids:
                    await db.delete(membership)
                    synced_count += 1
                    
            account.last_synced_at = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
            
        await db.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Sync worker failed: {e}")
        errors.append(str(e))
        await db.rollback()
        
    return {"synced_count": synced_count, "errors": errors}
```

### 5.3 Scheduler Setup
Schedule the job using **APScheduler**'s AsyncIOScheduler inside `apps/api/app/main.py`'s lifespan. Run every `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` env variable (default: 15).

***

## Phase 6 — FastAPI Core API (`apps/api/app`)

Core API layout, routes, JWT security middleware, and startup lifespans.

### 6.1 Server Lifespan Configuration
Create `apps/api/app/main.py`:
```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler
from app.config import settings
from app.database import engine, session_factory
from app.events.bus import event_bus
from app.plugin_sdk.loader import PluginLoader
from app.provisioning.client import DiscordClient
from app.provisioning.sync import run_sync
from app.routers import auth, iam, provisioning, plugins, audit, bot

scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # 1. Start event bus
    await event_bus.start()
    
    # 2. Discover and mount plugins
    loader = PluginLoader(app, session_factory)
    await loader.discover_and_load()
    app.state.plugin_loader = loader
    
    # 3. Schedule provisioning worker
    discord_client = DiscordClient(settings.discord_bot_token)
    scheduler.add_job(
        run_sync,
        "interval",
        minutes=settings.sync_interval_minutes,
        args=[session_factory, discord_client, settings.discord_guild_id]
    )
    scheduler.start()
    
    yield
    
    # Shutdown steps
    scheduler.shutdown()
    await engine.dispose()

def create_app() -> FastAPI:
    app = FastAPI(
        title="bnb-motherboard-api",
        version="1.0.0",
        lifespan=lifespan
    )
    
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=settings.allowed_origins,
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    
    app.include_router(auth.router, prefix="/api/auth", tags=["auth"])
    app.include_router(iam.router, prefix="/api/iam", tags=["iam"])
    app.include_router(provisioning.router, prefix="/api/provisioning", tags=["provisioning"])
    app.include_router(plugins.router, prefix="/api/plugins", tags=["plugins"])
    app.include_router(audit.router, prefix="/api/audit", tags=["audit"])
    app.include_router(bot.router, prefix="/api/bot", tags=["bot"])
    
    return app

app = create_app()
```

### 6.2 Settings Model
Create `apps/api/app/config.py`:
```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env", env_file_encoding="utf-8", extra="ignore")

    database_url: str
    session_secret: str
    api_internal_secret: str
    nextauth_secret: str
    
    discord_client_id: str
    discord_client_secret: str
    discord_bot_token: str
    discord_guild_id: str
    
    sync_interval_minutes: int = 15
    allowed_origins: list[str] = ["http://localhost:3000"]

settings = Settings()
```

### 6.3 NextAuth JWT Authentication Dependency
Verify JWT cookies issued by NextAuth using PyJWT or python-jose:

Create `apps/api/app/dependencies.py`:
```python
import uuid
from typing import Annotated, AsyncGenerator
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Request, status
from jose import jwt
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.config import settings
from app.database import session_factory
from app.iam.principal import ResolvedPrincipal, resolve_principal

async def get_db() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    async with session_factory() as session:
        try:
            yield session
        except Exception:
            await session.rollback()
            raise

DbDep = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_db)]

async def get_current_user(request: Request, db: DbDep) -> ResolvedPrincipal:
    token = request.cookies.get("next-auth.session-token") or request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not token:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Session token missing"
        )
        
    if token.startswith("Bearer "):
        token = token[7:]
        
    try:
        # Decode NextAuth session token containing discord details
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.nextauth_secret, algorithms=["HS256"])
        user_id = payload.get("sub") or payload.get("userId")
        if not user_id:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Invalid token subject")
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Invalid session token")

    try:
        principal = await resolve_principal(db, uuid.UUID(user_id))
        return principal
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail=str(e))

CurrentUserDep = Annotated[ResolvedPrincipal, Depends(get_current_user)]
```

***

## Phase 7 — Next.js Web App (`apps/web`)

The Next.js 15 app router manages dashboard views and handles auth callbacks with NextAuth.js.

### 7.1 NextAuth Upsert Callbacks
On sign-in, NextAuth performs a server-to-server upsert webhook call to the FastAPI app to ensure internal user profiles are correctly matched to the database:

Update `apps/web/lib/auth.ts`:
```typescript
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Discord from 'next-auth/providers/discord';

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Discord({
      clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      authorization: {
        params: { scope: 'identify email guilds.members.read' },
      },
    }),
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, account, profile }) {
      if (account) {
        token.discordId = profile?.id;
        token.accessToken = account.access_token;
      }
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      session.user.discordId = token.discordId as string;
      return session;
    },
    async signIn({ account, profile }) {
      // Upsert Discord account profile in FastAPI core DB
      await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/api/auth/upsert`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'X-Internal-Secret': process.env.API_INTERNAL_SECRET!,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          discord_id: profile?.id,
          username: profile?.username,
          email: profile?.email,
          avatar_hash: profile?.avatar,
          access_token: account?.access_token,
          refresh_token: account?.refresh_token,
          token_expires_at: account?.expires_at ? new Date(account.expires_at * 1000).toISOString() : null,
        }),
      });
      return true;
    },
  },
});
```

### 7.2 UI Plugin Mounting Router
Next.js loads the frontend UI of plugin components dynamically:

Update `apps/web/app/(dashboard)/plugins/[pluginId]/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`:
```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import { Skeleton } from '@bnb/ui';

export default async function PluginPage({ params }: { params: { pluginId: string } }) {
  const PluginPanel = dynamic(
    () => import(`@bnb-plugins/${params.pluginId}/ui`).catch(() => () => <div>Plugin UI panel not found</div>),
    { loading: () => <Skeleton className="h-96 w-full" />, ssr: false }
  );

  return <PluginPanel />;
}
```

***

## Phase 8 — Shared UI Package (`packages/ui`)

The UI components library is a Turborepo-managed workspace exporting custom components styled using **Tailwind CSS and Radix UI Primitives (Shadcn layout styling)**. 

Components must include:
*   `Button`, `Input`, `Select`
*   `Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`
*   `Table`, `Badge` (success, warning, error, info)
*   `Card`, `Skeleton`

Consuming apps configure Tailwind CSS paths to index the shared module classes automatically:
```ts
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  // ...
}
```

***

## Phase 9 — Discord Role Mapping UI

The administrative dashboard allows users to bind Discord guild roles to operational groups dynamically.

1.  Renders a matrix of Discord roles fetched via `GET /api/iam/discord-roles`.
2.  Allows selection of internal groups fetched via `GET /api/iam/groups`.
3.  Saves updates directly by invoking `PUT /api/iam/discord-mappings` (upsert updates).
4.  Displays blocking spinners during processing. No optimistic updates.

***

## Phase 10 — Dockerfiles and Production Compose

Docker files configured to support optimized production builds.

### 10.1 API Dockerfile (`docker/api.Dockerfile`)
Use Astral's `uv` image to package backend services:
```dockerfile
FROM astral-sh/uv:python3.11-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Enable bytecode compilation
ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1

# Copy dependency mappings
COPY apps/api/pyproject.toml apps/api/uv.lock ./
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-install-project

# Copy app code
COPY apps/api/app ./app
COPY apps/api/alembic ./alembic
COPY apps/api/alembic.ini ./

# Run production build
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app

ENV PATH="/app/.venv/bin:$PATH"
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### 10.2 Web Dockerfile (`docker/web.Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app

FROM base AS deps
COPY package.json bun.lock turbo.json ./
COPY packages/ui/package.json ./packages/ui/
COPY apps/web/package.json ./apps/web/
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

FROM base AS builder
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN bun run build --filter=apps/web

FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/package.json ./package.json
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

### 10.3 DB Migration Init Task
Add a lightweight migration script runner to ensure SQL updates complete successfully before launching production apps:
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  migrate:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/api.Dockerfile
    command: ["alembic", "upgrade", "head"]
    env_file: .env
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: on-failure

  api:
    depends_on:
      migrate:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
```

***

## Coding Conventions

### Backend (Python)

- **Coding Standard**: PEP 8.
- **Variable and File Names**: `snake_case`.
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`.
- **Type Annotations**: Mandatory on all function arguments and return signatures.
- **Route Definitions**: Use `Annotated` dependencies (e.g. `db: DbDep`) and explicit `response_model` definitions on every route.
- **Async Execution**: Use async handlers only for non-blocking I/O operations (HTTPX client calls, SQLAlchemy async executions). Use plain blocking `def` functions for code that is CPU-bound or blocking (runs in ThreadPool).
- **Unit Testing**: pytest with `httpx.AsyncClient` transport wrappers for route isolation.

### Frontend (Next.js & TypeScript)

- **Variables and Functions**: `camelCase`.
- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts`.
- **Components**: `PascalCase` matching file names exactly.
- **Type Checking**: Enforced strict null checks, no `as any` type-escaping.
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier.

***

## Definition of Done (Per Phase)

Each phase is complete when:

- [ ] All TypeScript compiles successfully without errors (`bun run typecheck`).
- [ ] Backend codebase linting/typechecking succeeds.
- [ ] No `any` annotations exist in TypeScript or untyped parameters in Python.
- [ ] Input parameters validate against strictly mapped Pydantic/Zod schemas.
- [ ] Tests execute successfully with zero failures.
- [ ] App logs clean executions upon invoking `docker compose up`.
